[Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) is awesome. A whole platform, not just some front-end JavaScript framework.

[This article](http://nerds.airbnb.com/isomorphic-javascript-future-web-apps/) covers history web applications' development.
I have just realized that my app does not need an [API](http://nerds.airbnb.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Screen-Shot-2013-11-07-at-10.29.32-AM.png). API is for third party developers. I don't need a back-end and a front-end divided by an API.

## Things I like about Meteor
I came from PHP and later Symfony with Angular background. Lastly I have worked with Gulp to build my own deployment model.
I just realized that in Meteor (if your app is simple enough) you don't need to use Gulp at all. Meteor give you sophisticated build and deployment process for free.

### Lifereload
When you start your your Meteor app on localhost, your project files are watched for changes. And browser reloads every time you save a file.
That means no more manual browser reloading. This mimic the same behavior with [gulp-watch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-watch) plugin and [Browsersync](http://www.browsersync.io/). In Meteor it's for free:D

### No script and link tags
In your *HTML* code you don't need to use `<script>` and `<link>` elements link your *JavaScript* and *CSS* files. Just put them in some directory and Meteor link them automatically.

### Minification
You don't need to concat and minify static assets, it is done automatically

### Cache busting
Automatic [cache busting](http://www.adopsinsider.com/ad-ops-basics/what-is-a-cache-buster-and-how-does-it-work/). Meteor adds new hash tag to your \*.js and \*.css files every time you change those files. Then any updated files are freshly downloaded to your browser.

And here following discussion on [Crater.io](https://crater.io/posts/8j5iT2Z8mgLcbxkGp).

Deployment should be easy with [Meteor up](https://github.com/arunoda/meteor-up)
